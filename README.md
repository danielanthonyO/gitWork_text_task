# Step-by-Step Guide for Working with Git (Local & Remote Repository)
Welcome 

## Introduction
This repository is designed to show case step by step guides working with Git. 

## 1. Create a File in Local Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to your project directory: cd path/to/your/project
Initialize a Git repository (if not already initialized): git init
Create a new file and add content: echo "Hello, World!" > file.txt
Stage and commit the file: git add file.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit with file.txt"

## 2. Connect to Remote Repository
Create a repository on GitHub (or another Git hosting service).
Copy the repository URL.
Link the local repository to the remote repository: 
git remote add origin <remote_repo_url>
Verify the remote: git remote -v

## 3. Push Local Changes to Remote Repository
Push the changes to the remote repository: 
git push -u origin main
